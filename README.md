## Project Overview

This website serves as an online resume and introduction to my professional background. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  The website includes sections for:

*   About Me
*   Education
*   Projects
*   Internships
*   Skills
*   Contact Information

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser:**

    The project does not require a local server for basic viewing, as it's built with client-side technologies.  Simply double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your preferred browser.

3.  **(Optional) Use a local server:**

    For development purposes, you might prefer using a local server. If you have Python installed, you can use the following command in the project directory:

    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```

    Then, access the website at `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## File Structure

The project has the following file structure:


## Customization

To personalize the website:

*   **Content:**  Edit the text within the `index.html` file to reflect your own information, skills, projects, and experiences.
*   **Styling:** Modify the `style.css` file to change the website's appearance, including colors, fonts, and layout.
*   **JavaScript:**  The `script.js` file contains basic animation logic.  You can extend it with more interactive features or modify the existing behavior.

## Deployment

To deploy the website, you can use platforms like:

*   **GitHub Pages:**  Host the website directly from your GitHub repository.
*   **Netlify:**  A popular platform for deploying static websites with continuous deployment features.
*   **Vercel:** Another platform offering similar features to Netlify.

Refer to the documentation of your chosen platform for specific deployment instructions.  Generally, you will need to connect your repository to the platform and configure the deployment settings.
